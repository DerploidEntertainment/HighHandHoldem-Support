### Changed in 0.5.0

- Procedural dealing logic to generate deals of all ranks with equal probability, while maintaining variability.
  - Deals are generated in the background to keep a consistent frame rate between rounds
  - A permutation of all Poker ranks is batched ahead of time for choosing the winning rank, with 0-3 "runs" per batch, each 2-3 repeats long.
    This ensures all ranks win with approximately equal probability, while preventing the same rank from winning too many rounds in a row,
    or from not appearing for too many rounds in a row, as might happen if we dealt truly randomly.
- Texture compression settings on all images for Android, achieving ~10% smaller APK download size and ~24% less memory consumption at runtime
- Texture compression settings on all images for iOS, achieving ~80% smaller IPA download size and install size, and ~94% less memory consumption at runtime

- Minimum target Android API Level up to 22 (Android 5.1 "Lollipop")
- Combined two FTUE (first-time user experience) dialogs into one, with updated wording
- Poker rank stats to report as % accuracy, not number of correct guesses
- Poker rank correct effects to always "pop" the cards in increasing order
- Support repo issue templates now use GitHub Issue Forms for better formatting and input validation
- Analytics system from Unity's Legacy Analytics to Unity Game Service analytics, for better performance and compliance with privacy laws
- Board cards and hands to be hidden until they are in play, with an animation as they are added
- Credits on About screen to more accurately reflect our team roles
- "Powered By" section of About screen to more accurately reflect our tech dependencies

- Internal: local Android builds to use a separate app ID so local test builds, debug cloud builds, and prod cloud builds can coexist on the same device.
- Internal: all internal repo "master" branches to "main", to use more inclusive language
- Internal: added the OpenUPM and UnityNuGet UPM package registries, allowing us to use NuGet packages in this project and simplify local build configurations
